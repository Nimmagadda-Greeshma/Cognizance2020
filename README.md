This is the world famous Kailasa temple at Ellora and let's look objectively into who could have built this amazing structure. By the end of this, I hope you will agree with me that our history might completely wrong, and that this temple was built by a very advanced civilization.
 
What is so special about this temple? This temple was not constructed by adding stone blocks, but an entire mountain was carved to create this temple. This is the only example in the whole world where a mountain was cut out from the top, to create a structure. In all the other temples and caves, even in Ellora and the rest of the world, the rock was cut from the front and carved as they went along. The whole world has followed a rock cutting technique called "cut-in monolith" while Kailasa temple is the only one that has used the exact opposite technique called "cut-out monolith".  
 
To see why this rock cutting technique is so different, let's look at this pillar that is over 100 feet tall.  See how small human beings look when compared to this pillar.
